# ðŸš€ Astro, Hygraph, Tailwind CSS Blog-Portfolio
## ðŸ‘€ A little bit about the project!
- My name is Romano Moesa and this is a project I created from scratch for a classical presentation at OWDDM (Osaka Web Designers & Web Developers Meetup). It might not be a complete or a beautiful project, because it will be up to you to that! ("evil" laughter) 

This was just a starter to introduce Astro and how it could be used as a headless CMS, in this case Hygraph was used. There was no special reason for doing so, was just reading articles on the internet and they were featured in one.

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of this Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files (only mentioned a few, too much, am too lazy, no time, but you get the idea):

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ fonts/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Futurewave.ttf

â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ assets/*
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ components/*
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ icons/*
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ js/

â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ global.css
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ env.d.ts
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ types.ts

â”œâ”€â”€ .env <=//Create this!

â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ tailwind.config.mjs
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory or in the `assets/` directory that I created for this project. More info on this link: https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/images/

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `npm run astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
| `npm run astro -- --help` | Get help using the Astro CLI                     |

## ðŸ‘€ Hygraph and .env variables (for security!)
For this project an existing example project in Hygraph was used, which is named "Developer Portfolio & Blog", use this when connecting to this project. Due to time constraints and nature of this project...the easy way was chosen.

### NOTES: 
- Not the whole "schema" is used from the Hygraph project due the main focus is on Astro.
- In other words it is always best to create only the things you need. This is the way!

## Configuration
In the .env file in the root replace the example keys with your own which you will find in your HyGraph account. You can get it from the HyGraph account. See details below:

API endpoint: Project settings > API access > Endpoints (copy/paste)
- Use either the "Content API" or the "High Performance Content API", your choice.

API Token: Project settings > API access > Permanent Auth Tokens (create/add token any name can be used)

In the .env file paste the token and endpoint, example below:
HYGRAPH_ENDPOINT=https://api-ap-northeast-1.hygraph.com/v2/xxxxxxxxxxxx/master
HYGRAPH_TOKEN=whateverTokenThatGotCreatedComesHereAndDoNotUseSpacesYesIKnowAPersonWhomUsedSpacesForBetterReadablity

Always remember the to check the .gitignore that the .env is listed (see example), because you do not want any API keys listed on GIT, some exceptions can be applied for Public API, but if you can...just don't.

example .gitignore
... # environment variables ...
.env
.env.production

- Install a webhook in Hygraph goto => Apps and search for Netlify and install it.

## ðŸ‘€ Deploy on Netlify
This is pretty straighforward. 
- Log in Netlify
- Add a site from your GitHub account
- Give your project a name and leave all the BUILD settings as is, no changes are needed.
- Add ENV variables
